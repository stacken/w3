After the event, if you like to contact us see the page
[Forum](forum). You are also welcome to our club room at any
Thursday evening (after 7 PM).

## Stacken
Stacken Computer Club is open for students or employees at the Royal
Institute of Technology founded in 1978. We have a clubroom located in the
Q-building where we have a room with a sofa, fridge, kitchen and of course
plenty of computers. Also we have a server hall where we run several
services like storage, email and web pages. The club is a student
organization under THS, the official student union at KTH.

The club has plenty of knowledge among its members, we have everything from
new students who are here to learn and use the clubroom to study, all the
way to older members that have moved on and started to work with everything
from programming to administration of large clusters of servers.

Thursday evenings from 7 PM are our traditional day where we meet in the
clubroom and build something, debug a problem or discuss something
interesting. If you are interested you are always welcome at any Thursday
evening, knock at our door at the 2nd level in the Q-building.
