We have finally scheduled this fall's introductory lectures in programming. The lectures will be held in room Q24 on the KTH main campus, starting on wednesday next week. The full schedule is as follows:

- Introduction to Python - Wednesday 2 oct, 18:00

- Introduction to Java - Wednesday 9 oct, 18:00

- Introduction to Git - Wednesday 16 oct, 18:00

The programming lectures will be aimed towards thos who have never coded before, or who have played around with python or Java but never written any larger programs.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

All lectures will begin with a presentation, followed by a practise session where students can work on problems themselves. If you are interested in helping out during the practise sessions, either let us know or simply show up at your preferred lecture(s).

Here's the [slides from the git introduction](https://rasmus.krats.se/tmp/slides/git.html).
