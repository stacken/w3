**Update** The lecture has been postponed to an unknown thursday due
to illness. We apologize for the inconvenience this might have caused
you. And we hope that you can still attend this lecture.

Do you want to sense or control something? An overview of three easy
and inexpensive roads to getting started with embedded systems;
hardware and software.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Requirements: It helps if you know a programming language and
(roughly) what a Volt is.

By Stellan Lagerstr√∂m, who studied EE at KTH once upon a time, and has
used all three systems professionally. (And some others.)
