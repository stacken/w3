**Do you want to sense or control something?** An overview of GPIO;
what it is, how it’s done and what you need to do it, using one of
three systems:

**Arduino**, **Raspberry Pi** and **ESP 8266**, simple and affordable
ways of getting started with embedded systems — hardware and software.

Requirements: It helps if you know a programming language and
(roughly) what a volt is.

By Stellan Lagerström, who studied EE at KTH once upon a time, and has
since managed to get paid to build stuff with all three devices.
